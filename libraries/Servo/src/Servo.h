/**
 * The class Servo uses the PWM class to implement its functions
 *
 * The PWM1 module is only used to generate interrups at specified times. It
 * is NOT used to directly toggle pins. The ISR writes to the pin assigned to
 * that interrupt
 *
 * All PWMs use the same repetition rate - 20mS because that's the normal servo rate
